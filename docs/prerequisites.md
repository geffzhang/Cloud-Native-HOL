**Before arriving at the event** you should make sure your laptop workstation has the following:

> ℹ Assuming PC, but if you have a Mac you should have [comparable tooling installed](https://github.com/rockfordlhotka/Cloud-Native-HOL/blob/master/docs/prerequisites-mac.md).

1. Windows 10 2004 or later
1. Visual Studio 2022
1. Install/activate the [HyperV feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) in Windows
1. [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
   1. The following assumes Ubuntu or Debian
   1. Inside WSL install `sudo apt install git`
   1. Inside WSL install the Azure CLI command (Use the instructions at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest)
   1. Inside WSL install the Kubernetes CLI commands (Use the instructions at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-linux) ⚠️Kubernetes is not installed yet, so `kubectl` commands will not yet work
   1. You may want to follow the instructions in this blog so [WSL can seamlessly interact with Docker Desktop](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly)
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) on Windows
1. Using Chocolatey from an _admin_ command line (cmd or PowerShell)
   1. `choco install dotnetcore-sdk` (or install the latest [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) manually)
   1. `choco install git`
   1. `choco install microsoft-windows-terminal`
   1. `choco install docker-desktop`
   1. `choco install kubernetes-cli`
   1. `choco install kubernetes-helm`
   1. `choco install azure-cli`
   1. `choco install vscode` (or install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) manually)
1. Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop
   1. Open the Docker Desktop settings page
   1. Select the Kubernetes tab
   1. Check the option to enable Kubernetes
   1. Restart Docker Desktop
   1. It may take several minutes to download and initialize the Kubernetes cluster images
1. Pull large Docker base images
   1. `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0`
   1. `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:6.0`
   1. `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0`
1. Clone this repo to your workstation: `git clone https://github.com/rockfordlhotka/Cloud-Native-HOL.git`
   1. There may be some last-minute fixes to the code so we recommend waiting to clone the repository until a day or two prior to the HOL
